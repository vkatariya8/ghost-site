            <p>Manappuram is a Gold Finance company with a large retail base of customers. After very strong growth between 2009 and 2011, they suffered de-growth in customer numbers between 2012 and 2014.</p>

<p>Last few years have seen company going back to growing its customer base. This started happening even before Gold Price bottomed in Dec 2014.</p>

<p>This analysis compares the Google Search Volume (for term "Manappuram") with the level of customer additions in Manappuram's Gold Finance business.</p>

<p><strong>Google Trends for "Manappuram" from 2004 till date:</strong></p>

<p>Manappuram appears to be doing something right to attract customer interest again (at least, in online). Google Search Volume appears to be in a strong uptrend.</p>

<p><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NH_FuROBgPM/V233TxU5SZI/AAAAAAAAC60/G9Z8NOAdcKAoN-nGn80lWrsh8XP8yoZ2gCLcB/s320/Googlr%2BSearch%2BVolume%2Bfor%2BManappuram.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Correlation of Google Search Volume with Customer growth:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qHczuzZYLOA/V2eOjGoPnQI/AAAAAAAAC4U/JHTqWz5liMgvlBYfvLTVZV_5qFN_X1weACLcB/s320/Manappuram%2BGoogle%2BTrends%2Bvs%2BCustomer%2BGrowth_Jun%2B2016.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As can be seen from above picture, the trend of Google Search Volume closely tracks the level of customer addition, through the previous cycle of falling growth, stabilisation and the ongoing phase of growth coming back in customer acquisition. Statistically, Correlation Coefficient for these two series is 0.62, which is significant.</p>

<p>Google Search volume has been especially strong in the last few quarters. This could partly be influenced by their new Online Gold Loan product. Or could be due to some online marketing which Manappuram is doing for its traditional Gold Loan product. </p>

<p>It would be interesting to compare the Q1 (FY17) customer addition numbers to verify this hypothesis.</p>
